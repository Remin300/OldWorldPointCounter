                    <h6>Deployment</h6>
                    <p>
                        Once the battlefield has been set up, the winner of a roll-off
                        chooses which player will deploy the first unit. The winner
                        of this roll-off must also choose their deployment zone (A or
                        B), as shown on the map opposite. Players deploy their armies
                        using the alternating units method, as described on page 285.
                    </p>

                    <h6>First Turn</h6>
                    <p>
                        Once deployment is complete, the winner of a roll-off takes
                        the first turn. The player that finished deploying their army
                        first adds +1 to their roll.
                    </p>
                    <h6>Game Length</h6>
                    <p>
                        Before the game begins, players can choose to play a ‘fixed’
                        length game or a ‘random’ length game: Fixed Game Length: The battle will last for six rounds, until
                        one side concedes, or until the time limit agreed by the players
                        is reached, as described on page 286.
                        Random Game Length: The battle will last a random number
                        of rounds or until one side concedes. Starting at the end of the
                        fifth round, roll a D6 at the end of each round. Add the round
                        number to the dice roll. If the total is 10 or more, the battle
                        ends immediately. If the total is less than 10 then the battle
                        continues for at least one more round.

                    <h6>Game Length</h6>
                    <p>
                        There is no turn limit for this scenario. Instead, the battle
                        will last until one side reaches its ‘break point’ or until one
                        side concedes.
                    </p>
                    <h6>Scenario Special Rules</h6>
                    <p>
                        Break Point: All armies have a breaking point. This is equal to
                        a quarter (25%) of the total Unit Strength of the army at the
                        start of the game. To calculate the break point of your army,
                        simply add together the Unit Strength of every unit (including
                        characters) in your muster list and divide the total by four,
                        rounding fractions down.
                        With each model removed from play as a casualty and with
                        each unit destroyed, an army approaches its break point.
                        If, during any Start of Turn sub-phase, the remaining Unit
                        Strength of either army has fallen below its break point, that
                        army is considered to have ‘broken’. At this point, the game
                        ends as models begin to flee, crumble into dust, dematerialise,
                        and so forth.
                        (Note that units that have pursued a fleeing enemy off the
                        battlefield and units held in reserve count as being on the battlefield
                        for the purposes of determining whether or not an army has reached
                        its break point).
                    </p>
                    <h6>Victory!</h6>
                    <p>
                        If the game ends with one army having broken, the unbroken
                        army achieves a crushing victory. Should both armies fall
                        below their break point at the same time, use Victory Points
                        to determine which player is the winner, as described on
                        page 286.

                    <p>
                        Once the battlefield has been set up, the winner of a roll-off
                        chooses which player will deploy the first unit. The winner
                        of this roll-off must also choose their deployment zone (A or
                        B), as shown on the map opposite. Prior to deployment, both
                        players secretly divide their armies into two forces – the main
                        force and the flanking force:
                        • A flanking force must contain at least one non-character
                        unit and can be worth up to 33% of the total points value
                        of the army (for example, in a 2,000 points game, your
                        flanking force may be worth up to 666 points).
                        • A flanking force may include characters, but cannot
                        include the General.
                        Once flanking forces have been selected, each player secretly
                        makes a note of which flank (left or right) theirs will be
                        deployed upon. Then, starting with the player that won the
                        roll-off, the players deploy their main forces within their
                        central deployment zone, using the alternating units method,
                        as described on page 285.
                        Finally, after both players have finished deploying their main
                        forces, the players reveal where their flanking forces are to be
                        deployed. Starting with the player that won the roll-off, the
                        players deploy their flanking forces within their chosen 18"
                        flank zone, using the alternating units method.

                        Before deploying their army, each player rolls a D6 for each
                        unit, including each character and war machine, in their army.
                        On a roll of 1, the unit must be held back as reserves (see
                        below). Once a roll has been made for each unit, those that
                        are not held in reserve can be deployed. Players deploy their
                        armies using the alternating units method, as described on
                        page 285.

                    <h6>First Turn</h6>
                    <p>
                        Once deployment is complete, the winner of a roll-off takes
                        the first turn. The player that finished deploying their army
                        first adds +1 to their roll.

                        The battle will last for six rounds, until one side concedes,
                        or until the time limit agreed by the players is reached, as
                        described on page 286.

                        Reserves: Reserves are not deployed at the start of the
                        battle. Instead they can enter play during the Compulsory
                        Moves sub-phase of any turn – other than the first – of their
                        controlling player’s choosing. When they arrive, reserves may
                        enter the battlefield from any point on the long battlefield edge
                        within their deployment zone, and move on using the rules for
                        reinforcements (as described on page 134).

                        The battle will last a random number of rounds or until one
                        side concedes. Starting at the end of the fifth round, roll a D6
                        at the end of each round. Add the round number to the dice
                        roll. If the total is 10 or more, the battle ends immediately. If
                        the total is less than 10 then the battle continues for at least
                        one more round.

                        Bottleneck: The battle is fought in a narrow mountain pass
                        enclosed by high cliffs. Because of this, the long battlefield
                        edges count as impassable terrain. As such, no units (including
                        fleeing units or any arriving from reserve) can leave or enter
                        the battlefield via either long edge unless they have the
                        Ethereal or Fly special rule.

                        fifth round, roll a D6 at the end of each round. Add the round
                        number to the dice roll. If the total is 10 or more, the battle
                        ends immediately. If the total is less than 10 then the battle
                        continues for at least one more round.
